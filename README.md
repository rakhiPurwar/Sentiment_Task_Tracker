# Overview
The customer experience is more important than ever before. Increased globalization
means consumers have no shortage of options to choose from when they’re in the market
for products and services. In many cases, the customer experience is the only thing setting
one business apart from another. Given the importance of customer service, it’s no
surprise that companies are turning to call center outsourcing services for support.
We have a task tracking system that is used by Agents/Supervisors to capture customer
requests and process them.
# Goals
1. Identify the sentiment in the customer service request to access the level of support
needed so Agents/Supervisors can ensure 100% satisfaction to customers.
2. Analyze trends that show reputation and scope for improvements with the product
or support system.

# Specifications
- [x] Develop a machine learning model that can be trained or tuned in future by
supervisors.
- [x] Need UI for supervisors to review the decisions made by model
- [x] Need ability to rerun the model by changing train/test data.
- [ ] Need API endpoints to interact with the deployed model from any internal MAP
systems.
- [x] Analyze trends based on prediction history
  - [x] To show reputation of task categories
  - [x] Accounts that have series of negative feedbacks so supervisors can follow up
with them using different mechanisms
